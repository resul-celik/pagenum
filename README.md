# Figma Pagenum Plugin

Pagenum makes it simple to create page numbers within frames.

## How it works

### 1. Add the pattern into the frames

You should start by adding the pattern to the frames. When you open the plugin, you can see the pattern. The pattern's default value is $p, but you can change it. Make sure it's unique and doesn't include any terms from the text that you don't want to change.

### 2. Select all those frames that have your pattern

When you've decided on your pattern and inserted it into the frames you want to order, click the 'Paginate' button. The frames will then be paginated by frame index by Pagenum.

**It's important: You can change the frame order in Figma's layers panel if you change the index.**
